I'm a tenure-track faculty member at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de) since October 2021. Previously, I completed my PhD at ETH Zurich in the [System Security Group](https://syssec.ethz.ch) under the supervision of [Srdjan Capkun](https://syssec.ethz.ch/people/capkun). 

My research interests are broadly in computer security with a particular focus on security and privacy aspects of digital currency and smart contract systems as well as some aspects of trustworthy computing. In my research, I combine techniques from cryptography, distributed systems, and trusted hardware to build systems that are practical and balance the trade-off between reducing trust assumptions and high performance. For more information about my research, have a look at my recent [publications](/publications). You can also find my publications on my [google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=F5oUrWAAAAAJ).

I am currently looking for PhD students. If you are interested in working with me, check out [open positions](/positions) for more details and get in touch with me.

I also supervise Bachelor and Master theses. If you are interested in a thesis, please contact me via [email](mailto:{{ site.email | encode_email }}). Make sure to include `[Thesis]` in the subject line, and attach your CV and transcript of records.
